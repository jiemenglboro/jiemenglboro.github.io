<br>

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor). Prior to Liverpool, I worked at <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au">University of New South Wales</a>, and <a href="http://iscas.ac.cn">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>.  
My research concerns the correctness (e.g., safety, trustworthiness, etc) of autonomous systems, including
<ul>
<li> safety verification and testing of machine learning techniques such as neural network-based deep learning, and </li>
<li> logic-based approaches for the specification, verification and synthesis of autonomous multi-agent systems. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Workshop Organisation </h2>
<ul>
<li> (02/2019) SafeAI will be held again, as a workshop of IJCAI2019, website: <a href="https://www.ai-safety.org/">https://www.ai-safety.org/</a>.

Great to see the enthusiasm of the crowd over AI and machine learning. 
</li>
<li> (03/2019) Our paper titled "Analyzing Deep Neural Networks with Symbolic Propagation: Towards Higher Precision and Faster Verification" is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09866">available</a> on arXiv. It is an improvement of abstract interpretation with symbolic propagation for the verification of DNNs. 
</li>
<li> (03/2019) Francesco Crecchi will visit from March to May.

</li>
<li> (09/2018) Join the program committee of a <a href="https://secml2018.github.io">NIPS workshop on security in machine learning</a>. 
</li>
<li> (09/2018) Slides of my talk at Nanjing University can be found <a href="slides/testing_DNN.pdf">here</a>. 
</li>

<li> (07/2018) Our paper titled "A Game-Based Approximate Verification of Deep Neural Networks with Provable Guarantees" is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03571">available</a> on arXiv. The paper summarises our efforts on using Lipschitz continuity and two-player games to achieve the verification. The provable guarantee solely relies on the Lipschitz constants. Except for the maximum safe radius problem as a cooperative game, we also studied feature robustness problem as a competitive game. 
</li>
<li> (07/2018) Our new paper titled "Concolic Testing for Deep Neural Networks", coauthored with Youcheng Sun, Min Wu, Wenjie Ruan, Marta Kwiatkowska, Daniel Kroening, has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00089">available</a> from arXiv. This paper has been conditionally accpeted to ASE2018. We will update a new version very soon. 
</li>
<li> (06/2018) Our journal paper "An epistemic strategy logic", coauthored with <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~meyden/">Ron van der Meyden</a>, has been accepted to the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL).

<li> (04/2018) Our new paper "Global Robustness Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks with Provable Guarantees for L0 Norm" is <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05805">available</a> on arXiv. 
</li>
<li> (04/2018) Our paper titled "Reachability Analysis of Deep Neural Networks with Provable Guarantees" 
has been accepted to IJCAI2018. The paper is co-authored with Wenjie Ruan (Oxford) and Marta Kwiatkowska (Oxford).
We present a novel, global optimisation based, approach to study the properties (e.g., robustness, output range, safety, etc) of deep neural networks 
with provable guarantees. Different with constraint-based approaches, our new approach is not affected by 
the internal structure of the networks, and therefore it is able to handle state-of-the-art networks. The paper has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02242">available</a> on arXiv.
</li>
<li> (04/2018) Our paper titled "Model Checking Probabilistic Epistemic Logic for Probabilistic Multiagent Systems"
has been accepted to IJCAI2018. The paper is co-authored with Chen Fu (CAS), Andrea Turrini (CAS), Lei Song, Yuan Feng (UTS),
and Lijun Zhang (CAS). It presents a model checking algorithm (and its tool) for probabilistic multiagent systems with respect to a probabilistic epistemic logic PETL.
</li>
<li> (04/2018) got an Defence Science Technology Laboratory (Dstl) project on "Test Coverage Metrics for Artificial Intelligence", which will run from 2018 to 2019. 
We are going to explore software testing techniques for the safety of deep neural networks.

It is co-authored with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theyoucheng/"> Dr Youcheng Sun </a> and <a href="http://www.kroening.com/"> Prof Daniel Kroening </a> from Oxford. 
The paper proposes a set of white-box test coverage criteria and test case generation algorithms for DNNs. It is a big step towards developing software testing approaches on systems with deep learning components. </li>
<li> (01/2018) gave a short talk and served as a panelist for ERTS 2018 at Toulouse, France. The panel was organised by Airbus. </li>
<li> (12/2017) our paper titled "Feature guided blackbox testing of deep neural networks" has been accepted to TACAS'2018. It is co-authored with Matthew Wicker from University of Georgia, USA, and <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/marta.kwiatkowska/"> Prof Marta Kwiatkowska </a> from Oxford. The full paper is available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07859"> here. </a>  The paper proposes a black-box testing algorithm based on SIFT object detection technique and Monte-carlo tree search algorithm. The algorithm can achieve guarantee on the safety, and thus is also an verification approach. </li> 
<li> (12/2017) gave talks on "Verification of Deep Learning Systems" at Beijing (Beijing University and Tsinghua University) and Xi'an (Xidian University). Slides are available from <a href="slides/verification_DNN.pdf">here.</a> </li>
