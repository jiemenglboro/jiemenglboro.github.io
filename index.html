<h2>Potential PhD <a href="https://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/phd-awards"> Opportunity</a>, </h2>
PhD Studentships in Digital Technologies at Loughborough University London
<br>

The Institute for Digital Technologies at Loughborough University London aims to address major technological 
challenges, with a focus on machine learning, data analytics, Internet of Things, cyber security, intelligent mobility, 
immersive and interactive technologies, 5G applications, and human behaviour analysis. It has secured funding for three 
full-time PhD studentships working on these exciting research areas for three years, opening to all UK/EU applicants 
and starting in October 2019. In particular, there are a few areas of interests regarding computational advertising and 
intelligent new media that I would like to recruit PhD students. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3> Area 1 - Online Influencer, Consumer Ego, and Personalised Web Advert in Decentralised Communication Era </h3>

Computational advertising, a.k.a. online advertising, which takes its forms of social media advertising, 
web advertising, search engine optimisation, AI recommendation and many others, refers to finding the most relevant ads 
matching a particular context on digital media with content. The context includes consumer personal feature and 
self-cognition, decision environment, brand endorser or online influencer, and media vehicles. The content means 
the marketing forms of persuasion regarding product, brand, and service etc. <br>
<br>
For long time, the connection between context and content has triggered intensive theoretical discussions all but 
remains a black box to generate plausible explanations. In digital era, the invasive application of smart tools with 
information retrieval, large scale search and text analysis and machine learning, can facilitate the linkage to the
 optimisation practices by reaching a maximised communication effect at the lowest cost.<br>

<h4> Objectives:</h4> 
•	To boost the current understanding of consumer egoism in digital context; <br>
•	To systematically investigate the roles of consumer self-cognition and expectation in consumer online content browsing 
behaviours with digital interface; <br>
•	To anchor the measure of cognitive dissonance for consumer’s true self (digital clickstream), mirrored self 
(self-recognition), reference self (influencer) and projective self (brand); <br>
•	To experimentise the algorism via different machine learning methods of smart commercial content which presents 
the best fit of consumer features, web browsing footprints, brand characteristics and influencer traits for a personalised 
communication; <br>
•	To test the feasibility and robustness of intelligent advertising, i.e. how to collect, analyse, and leverage 
information from diverse pipelines, inclusive of  consumer clickstream (for preference or characteristics), consumer 
dynamic data from experiment test (for personality and decision reasoning), and interpersonal information 
(for other contexts such as social influence or peer referencing etc), to build a diagnostic tool for computation 
advertising for generalisable online content optimisation purpose; <br>
•	To theorise the mechanism of how to use the computational ads optimisation techniques to customise the suitable digital 
content and influencer to best trigger their further engagement and action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3> Area 2 – Consumer Trust and Decision on AI Tools </h3> 
<br>
The digital technology and smart devices embedded with AI algorism has freed consumers from comprehensive mental 
cognition and reasoning procedure for an optimised decision pursuit, while at the same time has created massive concerns 
on the privacy, trustworthiness and ethics which as a part of the loop cause the user demerit on their trust. Bearing the 
research questions as (1) what is the consumer trust on the smart tools and (2) how does the trust is built and changed 
with the scenario and transparency of the signals, this project is going to be featured by a series of experiment-dominant 
lab studies on the reasoning pathways on visuals - behavioural verification from the simulated environment online 
experiments for conviction, trust, advocacy, and so forth.<br>

<h4> Objectives:</h4> 
<br>
•	To unveil the mechanism of trigger, formation, evolution, and corruption of digital efficacy and human-machine trust 
established on hardware and digital experience; <br>
•	To integrate the currency of computational social choice to address the aggregation of personal preference, 
cognition, social reference and human-machine interaction from a computational perspective; <br>
•	To understand the role of information disclosure in the Person-to-Computer communication; <br>
•	To furthermore observe how the three clues- personal, interpersonal, social dimensions of impacts intertwine with 
the cognitive process to trigger the progressive cognitive and emotional engagement with the content and decisions;<br>
•	To extend the findings by applying the simulation to generate the foresights.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3> Area 3 - Social Media and Democracy</h3> 
<br>
In every democracy, the legislature provides an interactive, participatory and deliberative platform for citizens’ input 
in the decision‐making process. It harnesses digital transformation tools and disruptive technologies for improving 
democratic processes, services and functions. Legislature’s representational roles include ensuring active citizens’ 
participation in the policy-making process; providing oversight and making laws. In the last five years, there has been 
an incremental rise in the usage of social media as a source of political information. This has engendered the political 
information, public opinions and the changing media environment while at the same time has provided opportunities for 
informed citizenry and participatory democracy (Lee & Kim, 2017). At present, the existing studies have focused on how 
political social media usage may influence political knowledge.<br>
 
Thus, this study will attempt to fill the gap in the extant literature by analysing how both political and general social 
media usage affect individual's political knowledge. Given the relative dearth of clear patterning of association between 
social media usage and political knowledge, the research aims to further investigate how the political usage of twitter 
affects political knowledge among citizens of emerging democracies. <br>

<h4> Objectives: </h4> 
•	To explain are the purposes of social media usages apart from information sharing; <br>
•	To explore the influence of both political and general social media usage on political learning and knowledge; <br>
•	To examine mechanisms that drive non-positive or even negative relationship between social media and democracy; <br>
•	To propose cross-media approaches that examines the intersections between digital platforms and legacy media;<br>
•	To examine issues of cybersecurity especially with governments trying to influence elections of other countries with the use 
of bots and data privacy issues; effective regulation of social media for political usages to curb misinformation 
and propaganda; <br>
•	To propose cross-media approaches that examines the intersections between digital platforms and legacy media;<br> 
•	Examine issues of cybersecurity especially with governments trying to influence elections of other countries 
with the use of bots and data privacy issues; effective regulation of social media for political usages to curb 
misinformation and propaganda. <br>
